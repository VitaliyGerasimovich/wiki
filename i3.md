# i3

## General

### Basic concepts
`Tree`
  i3 keeps your layout in a tree data structure.
  
`Window`
  An X11 window, like the Firefox browser window or a terminal emulator.
  
`Floating Window`
  A window which "floats" on top of other windows. This style is used by i3 to display X11 windows with type "dialog", such as the "Print" or "Open File" dialog boxes in many GUI applications. Use of floating windows can be fine-tuned with the for_window command.

`Split Conttainer`
  A split container contains multiple other split containers or windows.

  Conttainers can be used in various layouts. The default mode is called "default" and just resizes each client equally so that it fits.
  
`Workspace`
  A workspace is a set of containers. Other window managers call this "Virtual Desktops".
  
  In i3, each workspace is assigned to a specific virtual screen. By default, screen 1 has workspace 1, screen 2 has workspace 2 and so on... However, when you create a new workspace (by simply switching to it), it'll be assigned the screen you are currently on.
  
`Output`
  Using XRandR, you can have an X11 screen spanning multiple real monitors. Furthermore, you can set them up in cloning mode or with positions (monitor 1 is left of monitor 2).
  
  i3 uses the RandR API to query which outputs are available and which screens are connected to these outputs.

### Files
When starting, i3 looks for configuration files in the following order:
1. ~/.config/i3/config (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3/config is set)
2. ~/.i3/config
3. /etc/xdg/i3/config (or $XDG_CONFIG/i3/config is set)
4. /etc/i3/config
You can specify a custom path using the -c option.
